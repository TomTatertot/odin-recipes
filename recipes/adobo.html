    <p> Adobo is a traditional Filipino dish and cooking method involving marinating and braising meat, 
        often chicken or pork, in a flavorful vinegar-based sauce. <br>
        It's characterized by a blend of savory, 
        tangy, and unique flavors, with the meat becoming tender and the sauce developing a rich, reduced consistency. <br>
        Adobo is often considered the unofficial national dish of the Philippines. </p>
