    <p> 
        Sinigang is a popular Filipino sour and savory soup dish, often considered a national comfort food. <br> 
        It's made with a protein (like pork, beef, chicken, or seafood) and vegetables simmered in a sour broth, usually made from tamarind or other souring agents. <br>
        The broth is typically enhanced with garlic, onions, and sometimes fish sauce or miso.
